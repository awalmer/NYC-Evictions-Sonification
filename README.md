# New York City Evictions Data Sonification

In the midst of an affordable housing crisis, New York City has faced an ongoing problem of eviction. In 2017, the city reached a peak level of evictions, with over 20 thousand New Yorkers being asked to leave their home. While the COVID-19 pandemic moratorium gave New Yorkers a break from this threat, evictions are now back on the rise.\

This data sonification conveys the rate of housing evictions in New York City from January 2017 to October 2024.

### Design Rationale:
**Mapping:** Lower, louder notes correspond to larger eviction rates, while higher, quieter notes correspond to smaller eviction rates. I made this choice because the deeper notes have a more resounding, impactful effect.
**Musical key:** C Aeolian. Thematically, the topic of resident evictions is a somber one. I wanted the tone to reflect that.
**Additional audio:** I captured audio from news segments on YouTube, as well as cricket sounds from freesound.org. The news segments are meant to help tell the story and inform the reader what historical/legislative events are happening over time.
**Additional time marker:** The trianlge sound indicates the passing of each year (temporal context).
