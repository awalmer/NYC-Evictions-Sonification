# NYC-Evictions-Sonification
### New York City Evictions Data Sonification Project

In the midst of an affordable housing crisis, New York City has faced an ongoing problem of eviction. In 2017, the city reached a peak level of evictions, with over 20 thousand New Yorkers being asked to leave their home. While the COVID-19 pandemic moratorium gave New Yorkers a break from this threat, evictions are now back on the rise.\

This data sonification conveys the rate of housing evictions in New York City from January 2017 to October 2024.
